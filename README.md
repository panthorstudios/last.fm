# last.fm-scripts
Python scripts for interacting with last.fm

I did these a few years ago to make a short summary of my last.fm listening habits. 

You'll need to add LASTFM_USER_NAME and LASTFM_API_KEY as environment variables (try .bash.profile).

```
./lastfm.py
```

creates an image showing the top 5 artists listened over the last 6 months. Something like this:

![Sample Image](images/lastfm-20150623.png Sample image)

I need to add customization, etc. but it suits my purpose.
